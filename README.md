# My Project Portfolio

## Description

I created this website as a consolidated representation of me as a potential employee. It provides a summary of my background and what I'm looking for in a career, followed by links to various deployed projects of mine. Capping it off are multiple options for reaching me. It is responsively designed to be viewed on any device/at different resolutions.
